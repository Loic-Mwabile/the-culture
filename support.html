        <h3>Quick FAQs</h3>
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li>
            <strong>What is The Culture?</strong>
            <p>A collection of bold social games designed to spark real conversation, connection, and chaos. It's part party, part therapy, part thought lab.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How do I play?</strong>
            <p>Choose a game, gather your crew, and follow the prompts. Some games have timers, some have phases — all are meant to stir something in you.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Is this for deep convos or fun vibes?</strong>
            <p>Both. The Culture is designed to shift between funny, intense, vulnerable, wild, and philosophical — sometimes in the same round.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Can I play alone?</strong>
            <p>Some games like Mental Gym are solo-friendly, but the real magic happens with 2+ people. It’s built for shared experiences.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Is there a way to suggest prompts or games?</strong>
            <p>Yes! We're all about community fuel. Drop your ideas on our <a href="#">feedback page</a> or DM us on socials.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What age group is this for?</strong>
            <p>Mostly Gen Z & young adults, but anyone down for raw convos and weird laughs will fit right in. Some games may touch on mature themes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does it work offline?</strong>
            <p>Yes! Once the page is loaded, most games can run without an internet connection. Ideal for dorms, road trips, or Wi-Fi dead zones.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Is it free?</strong>
            <p>Yup — 100% free for now. We just want you to play and connect. In the future, premium features might drop, but the core will always be open.</p>
          </li>
