# the-culture

## 🧠 Problem

In a world where phones dominate even the most social settings, real human connection is fading—especially among the youth. We’re constantly online but rarely present. Parties, game nights, hangouts—these are meant to spark joy, not screen time.
Rather than fighting tech, let's **use it to bring us closer**.
