      <h1>About The Culture</h1>
      <p>
        The Culture is more than a collection of games. It’s a movement to bring people together,
        especially the youth, by making meaningful and unforgettable experiences using social games.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where screens dominate our time, The Culture redefines how we connect —
        using the very tech that distracts us, to bring us closer. It's playful, it's intentional,
        and it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's Truth or Dare, deep convos, or wild hypotheticals — there's something here
        for every vibe, every crew, every moment.
