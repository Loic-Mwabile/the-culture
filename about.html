      <h1>About The Culture</h1>
      <p>
        The Culture isn’t just a collection of games, it’s a social experiment, a playground for bold minds,
        and a space to unlock real human connection in the digital age.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world where distractions are endless and attention is short, The Culture flips the script.
        We use tech not to escape reality, but to face it, together. Through games that spark debate, challenge beliefs,
        and expose hidden truths, we create unforgettable moments that go deeper than small talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        From daring dilemmas and chaotic “what ifs” to intense mental face-offs, The Culture brings every vibe:
        truth-seekers, jokers, philosophers, rebels, introverts, loud crews, all welcome. It’s not just fun,
        it’s purposefully uncomfortable, radically honest, and surprisingly healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how connection was always meant to feel, raw, real, and unforgettable.
      </p>
